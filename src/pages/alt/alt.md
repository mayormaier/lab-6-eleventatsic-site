  ## Alternatives
  
  <p>Some other alternatives to 11ty are Gatsby, Jekyll, and Docsify. The major differences between these static site generators are the languages and frameworks that they are built on. For example, Gatsby is bult on JavaScript with react, and Jekyll is built on Ruby. These languages and frameworks are the source for the HTML files that are they generate.</p>

  ## Rationale
  
  <p>I wanted to focus on a static site generator for this lab because of how secure they are. I am looking to pursue a field in cyber security, so understanding a system that creates inherently secure websites interested me.</p>

  <p>11ty in particular was interesting because it is not bult on top of a framework like many other static site generators. Additionally, 11ty supports _numerous_ markup languages for creating content. I used markdown and liquid for this site, but many others are available to be used as well.</p>

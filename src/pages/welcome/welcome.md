  <p>For lab number 6 I decided to create a site using 11ty. 11ty is a static site generator that uses many different templating languages to build a site via static HTML files.</p>
  <br>
  <p>11ty uses the command line to get up and running, which is a bit intimidating at first, but once it it up and running it is easy to add on to.</p>
  <br>
  <p> 
  
  If youâ€™re interested in getting your own static site set up, you can find all the information on how to get started [on the 11ty website](https://www.11ty.dev). They have a great quick start guide that will get help setup a basic website with no bells and whistles.</p> 
  <br>

  <p> 
  
  If you're looking for something more advanced, they also have a collection of [starter projects](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/starter/) that have a larger codebase with some more advanced layout and styling. I used the "eleventastic" starter project for this site. You can find a link to the GitHub repository for that project on the bottom right of this website.  </p>

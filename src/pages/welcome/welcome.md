  For lab number 6 I decided to create a site using 11ty. 11ty is a static site generator that uses many different templating languages to build a site via static HTML files.

  11ty uses the command line to get up and running, which is a bit intimidating at fist, but once it it up and running it is easy to add on to.

  If you’re interested in getting your own static site set up, you can find all the information on how to get started [on the 11ty website](https://www.11ty.dev). They have a great quick start guide that will get help setup a basic website with no bells and whistles. If you're looking for something more advanced, they also have a collection of [starter projects](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/starter/) that have a larger codebase with some more advanced layout and styling. I used the "eleventastic" starter project for this site. You can find the GitHub repository for that project on the bottom right of this website.

  ## Pros of 11ty

  <p>

  - • creates static HTML files which are portable and can be shared from user to user easily (via 1 zip file!)<br>
  - • very easy to expand your website after initial setup<br>
    - • site additions can be made by non-technical people as long as they understand the syntax of markdown (or other templating languages)<br>
  - • Easy to replicate / clone sites<br>
  - • integrates well with GitHub and can be setup for automatic builds/updates when changes are made<br>
  - • inherently **secure** because the sites are fully static<br>
  - • works with MANY templating languages (I used markdown for this site)<br>

  </p>

  ## Cons of 11ty

  <p>

  - • utilizes a CLI in order to set up (no GUI) <br>
  - • need technical coding experience to understand configuration process<br>
  - • designed to be managed by a single user, which means that users cannot collaborate on a single page<br>
  - • does not handle dynamic data well (no queries)<br>
  - • no interface to work with, just editing .md files<br>

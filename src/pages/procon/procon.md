## Pros of 11ty

- creates static HTML files which are portable and can be shared from user to user easily (via 1 zip file!)
- very easy to expand your website after initial setup
  - site additions can be made by non-technical people as long as they understand the syntax of markdown (or other templating languages)
- Easy to replicate / clone sites
- integrates well with GitHub and can be setup for automatic push/pull when changes are made
- inherently **secure** because the sites are fully static
- works with MANY templating languages (I used markdown for this site)
  
## Cons of 11ty

- utilizes a CLI in order to set up (no GUI)
  - which sucks. It is hard and I had trouble
- need technical coding experience to understand configuration process
- designed to be managed by a single user, which means that users cannot collaborate on a single page
- does not handle dynamic data well (no queries)
- no interface to work with, just editing .md files
